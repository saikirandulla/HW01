# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. 
# Pythons syntax for math operations is almost the same as 
# standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols 
# +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. 
# The symbol for multiplication is *.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your 
# average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? 
# (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).
# Average Speed in MPH:

Miles = 10/1.61
Time = 43.5/60
MPH = Miles/ Time
TPM = 1/ MPH
print MPH
print TPM
